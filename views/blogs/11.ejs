  <h1>Ruminations from Social Distancing</h1>
  <h4>April 19th, 2020</h4>

  <center><img src = "/favicon.png" /></center>

  <div class = "text">
    <p>
      Let's begin with the absolute facts:
      <br/><br/>
      For those who read this after social distancing measures are lifted, allow me to recount what has happened. A novel strand of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, began in the Chinese city of Wuhan. No treatments existed for coronavirus strains, the most famous before this one being SARS and MERS, and given it was a novel virus, no human had naturally developed immunity to it, like humans do for viruses that are more common. As more people became infected with the virus, it became clear that the virus was incredibly contagious, exponentially more so than the seasonal flu virus, and it was very clear the virus was lethal. While the death rate itself was 2%, the estimated rate of hospitalization (as of April 13, 2020), is 20%. In other words, roughly 20% of cases were life-threatening and required medical intervention (for instance a ventilator). Put bluntly, health care systems do not have the resources to support 20% of the world's population. Health professionals feared a 'run on hospitals,' a situation where there are too many life-threatening cases to treat and morbid decisions have to be made about who to save. The world had to take drastic efforts to prevent such a 'run on hospitals.' Universities all over the US had students leave campus and take the rest of their semester online. Firms all over the country had their employees stop working in the office. Finally, governments stepped in, issuing stay-at-home orders, only allowing people in essential businesses to go to work. Most pervasively, a strict distance of 6 feet was to be maintained between all people at all times (excluding family members or people you live in close quarters with). No one knows how long it will last, how many people will die before it gets contained, or how our world will change as a result of this pandemic.
      <br/><br/>
      Now, I'll give my thoughts on what has become clear to me during this pandemic
      <br/><br/>
      The issues of distrust in the media today have had disasterous impact during this crisis and are likely to continue being a weight on democratic societies unless they can be dealt with. Before I begin, I would like to make a distinction. Not all media organizations are culpable in the problems I'm about to lay out. Rather there exist enough bad actors out in the industry to seriously harm the good actor's goal of spreading information. That withstanding, there are two issues with media today as I see it. First, online media and its clickbait business model. Akin to the economics of yellow journalism, clickbait outlets are only economically viable when they can get outrageous numbers of viewers to their sites. Often times this means rather than publishing nuanced articles, they go for headlines that jump out at people. While it may be a nuisance to click on an article and find the headline was the most interesting part of it, the danger here for society becomes clear during the coronavirus pandemic. These headlines and articles spread horrific misinformation about dealing with the virus. Some people burned their faces with blowdryers trying to kill the virus, while others drank what was effectively poison to protect themselves. This kind of media is incredibly dangerous to the public. The solution to this will be complex, but I think that much like how the new business model of the New York Times destroyed yellow journalism at the turn of the 19th century, so too will new business models destroy these clickbait outlets. Ideally, these outlets would turn to publishing less sensationalist pieces and more news consistent with reality. Transitioning to the second issue with media today, the increasing polarization of mainstream news. Political newspapers are nothing new in the US. The press has consistently been used a vehicle to spread a political belief. What is new is the way that mainstream news outlets (in particular television news) has divorced many people from reality. Conceptions about the basic state of our country seem to vary wildly. The concern here is that the proportion of the country being polarized is increasing. As Lincoln so cogently put it early 162 years ago, "a house divided against itself cannot stand." While this reality was eating away at moderates before the pandemic, it is certainly frightening to see these machinations in action. After a crisis, blame will be cast. The polarized media has nonetheless begun dividing people on who to blame. With most of the facts stil under investigation, the media has rushed to dish out blame rather than wait to see what is supported by evidence. With the country already anxious, the media is getting people riled up. The solution to this problem is far more complex than for clickbait misinformation. The motives behind polarization are complex and individual. What gives me hope is that most people I speak with tell me blatantly that they do not like polarization. A society where everyone is ready to scream at the drop of the hat is a society ready to implode. Thus, the way out of a polarized news is desired, the question on everyone's minds is how to go forward. Clearly, the status quo must be changed.
      <br/><br/>
      The values society holds can never be out of convenience. Times of crisis show us just how what we value. In times of crisis, many behaviors and ways of life change. People's decisions suddenly have more consequences to them, and every individual has to start making decisions on what to give up. People have been told to limit their trips to the grocery stores, so individuals looking to eat only the freshest ingredients have to choose between going to many grocery stores, thus greatly risking their health, or eating less fresh ingredients. While this calculus is easy for most, the consequences of not eating the freshest foods in my eyes pail in comparison to hurting your health, the decision making gets more difficult when it comes to the power we give people mitigating the crisis. If there is one belief I think every human being on this planet agrees with at this moment it is that we want the pandemic to be over as soon as possible. However, some political officials will use that desire to claim more power than necessary for themselves. While so many people are making concessions about what matters to them, slimy politicians may take the opportunity to seize power that otherwise soceity wouldn't be alright with giving them. For this pandemic, the issue of privacy has suddenly become more contentious. Whereas before people would never let the government track who you met with, now because that information could help curb the spread of the virus people are more willing to give that information up. Governments are not only restricting travel out of countries, unheard of before, many are also taking temperatures of every passenger when they arrive. There is even talk currently of testing every citizen of the country to see who has the disease. At a time of crisis, these concessions don't sound as abhorrent as I'm sure they would have sounded before. With all these choices being made, I think back to some advice my father gave me. He told me to always know the value of what you have. If you don't, he warned, then you will always give it up for less than its worth. While as a society we cannot sit down and decide collectively what we care about, as individuals I believe this time is essential to do just that. Decide, outside of commentators or analysts, what aspects of your life before you care about most. Is Truth important to you? What about freedom of speech? freedom from danger? Whatever you decide matters to you, sticking by that value will not always be convenient. I doubt I'm the first one to tell you this, but allow me to put it in context of the coronavirus. Valuing freedom of speech means you will let someone with not only a differing view but a conflicting view of how to go back to normalcy speak. If you value freedom from dangers, then you must be willing to give away some of your other freedoms. No value is convenient, but they are what define us as people and as a society. During times of crisis, when we have to choose between different freedoms, what a society values most becomes clear.
      <br/><br/>
      The fragility of the past few days, exemplies the importance of making the most of the present. There is an old saying: Man plans, and God laughs. No matter where you are on the planet right now, plans have been altered. Whether they be graduation plans, travel plans, hiring plans, or even gardening plans, the pandemic has impacted every human being. The question now is what to take away from it all. It's very easy to get angry, indeed I would argue the default, and spend your time waiting for life to return to normal. But I believe this would simply be waisting a good chunk of your life. As a college student, I spend a good amount of time wondering what shape my life will take. Indeed, I spend a great deal of time doing nothing but preparing for the future. While I strongly believe in planning ahead, this tendency also prevents many, including myself, from living in the present when the time comes. The reality is everyone is having some regrets about how they spent their time pre-pandemic. I wouldn't want to have the same regrets about pandemic life once this is over. Make the most of the moment. Many people are going to have their life cut tragically short by this virus. But whether you die from the coronavirus or from some other condition, every human being dies eventually. Make the most of the present, no one knows what the future holds.

      With that stay well,
      <br/><br/>
      Onwards & Upwards
