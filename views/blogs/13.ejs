      For those who don't already know, on May 25th, 2020 former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin put his knee on George Floyd's neck until George died. Mr. Floyd could be heard saying 'I can't breathe' repeatedly, until he went unconscious. While George was unconscious, the officer kept his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck, only removing it when the paramedics arrived at the scene. There were three other police officers also at the scene who sat by and watched as George Floyd's life was brutally and inhumanely taken from him. In my opinion, this video shows one of the worst abuses of power by a police officer.
<br/><br/>
      Bystanders took video of the incident and shared it with social media. Within a day, outrage over George Floyd's murder spread across the country. The protests weren't only about the tragic death of Mr. Floyd; they were also about the abhorrent consistency with which black people in the United States face violence, discrimination, or mistreatment. George Floyd wasn't the only black person to have violence come upon him/her during a period when the country was supposed to be social distancing. Ahmaud Arbery, a young man in Georgia was shot while on a jog. His murderers were angered solely by his race and elected to harm him because of something Ahmaud had no control over. In another instance, Breonna Taylor was sleeping in her apartment one night in March. Unbeknownst to her, plain clothes police officers were waiting outside her apartment. These cops were there to conduct a no-knock warrant–– where police enter a residence without letting any of the residents know why. After the police broke through the front door, Taylor's current boyfriend, a licensed gun owner, thought a home invasion was in progress and shot at the invaders. In the ensuing chaos of the police entry, Breonna Taylor was shot eight times. Tragically, there are countless more who have lost their lives in similar ways.
<br/><br/>
      The horrifying consistency with which these events happen in our country necessitates change. No change is ever easy or perfect. But when citizens of the greatest democracy in history are consistently harmed physically or emotionally for parts of themselves completely out of their control, I strongly believe the status quo must be changed and must be changed quickly. Thankfully, it appears most Americans agree with that sentiment. Social media has been full of those voicing their anger about Floyd's death and the failure of the justice system it represents. We have reached the point where those in power have never been under more pressure to make real change.
<br/><br/>
      The vast majority of the organizing for this movement has been done on social media. Because social media has been the primary tool of organizers, the issues inherent to social media would harm the movement. In my view, there are 3 major issues with social media. First, there is the issue of vocal radicals. While real change is often spoken about on social media outlets, those spewing hate tend to get most of the attention. Rather than people discussing possible reform, the conversation devolves into insults being hurled left and right. We need immediate solutions, not mere rhetoric. Social Media, while great at getting attention to a cause, has the unfortunate side effect of making it harder for people to do more than raise the issues. The second issue with social media is perhaps its greatest strength. Social media connects people all over the globe together. While this makes it easier for ideas to flow, it can also result in people focusing on solutions that can only be implemented at the highest levels of government. While federal and national solutions are needed and must happen, the place most people can exert the most influence, and thus experience the greatest positive change fastest, is at the local level. When social media fills your feed with only the biggest events, it ends up leaving out local movements that could use the popular support. Finally, social media can also be overwhelming for a good part of the population. I hope I'm not shocking anyone by saying social media isn't an encyclopedia. There have been countless scams and misinformation campaigns on the platforms. Fake news is seen with horrible consistency. With all that disarray, it could be difficult to know what was a legitimate protest or donation site and what was malicious. The only way to really discern the difference is to read the event details carefully. To see if this was a likely event, I took a poll of seventy-one Lehigh University students, people who are in the age demographic of most protesters. When asked 'which do you read most carefully', only 4% of respondents chose social media. For a movement so important, clarity and nuance is critical. The vast majority of respondents, 52% and 44% respectively, chose text messages and emails as the medium they read most carefully.
<br/><br/>
      This is where Charla comes in. I wanted to use my computer science skills to help the cause. Charla was designed to make it easier for people to reach one another individually and sidestep many of the issues with social media. Addressing the problem of vocal radicals first, I fundamentally believe people act differently in groups than they do when talking one on one. I believe people are more open to ideas and even changing their minds when one speaks to another individual. It's not perfect, but speaking to a person individually has the benefit of not letting one person's radical views change the discussion of the movement. The focus is more resilient than if one were to have these discussions in a group chat or over social media. Discussing next the issue of locality, Charla here is a perfect way to reach out to local communities. The endorsement of a neighbor or a personal friend can help bring many people into the movement. Seeing that these issues matter to people in one's daily life can help galvanize support and move us to a more just society faster. Finally, regarding the issue of people not reading carefully what's on social media, the poll I took on Lehigh University students comes into play. Far and away text messages and emails were read more carefully than social media posts. This matters tremendously for the movement. When addressing problems that harm other human beings, one has to be sure the problem actually gets solved, rather than having people simply decide a symbolic victory is enough. If people barely read the social media posts, then not only are proposals not being fully understood, but the chance that unaffected people simply forget about the movement once they don't see it in their feeds every day goes up. Charla reaches out to people individually. It takes these ideas about making society more just directly to people's doorsteps. The goal with Charla is not to be the app that changes everyone's minds, but rather to make it so ideas can reach practically everywhere there's a cell phone. People read text messages even if they don't respond to them. To have someone you know reach out to you about a movement could be the way someone gets involved. At the end of the day, we need to band together to make our world a more just place. Solutions have to come. My goal with making Charla is to help propagate these ideas and events so we can more quickly create that just society.
