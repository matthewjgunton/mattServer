Inspired by all the creativity and innovation I saw there, I wanted to do nothing else but create when I got back to my apartment in Chelsea. Calling up my friend Brian Snyder, we decided to enter a DevPost competition. Choosing from a list of exciting tech to use, I chose the Alexa competition, both because we could show our friends what we made and because I'd never worked with Voice before and was eager to try it out. <br/><br/> We only had roughly 2 weeks to create the application, so we got to work immediately thinking of good ideas. After some back and forth, we chose a restaurant selector. I'm sure you've had arguments with friends and family about where to go for dinner. Someone suggests a restaurant, only for another to say "I don't feel like it." As annoying as that process is, solving the problem adds more value than just lower blood pressure. If you've ever rediscovered an old restaurant or found a new favorite, you know the power of getting suggestions that are outside the box. Satisified with our idea, we began the real work of building the skill. <br/><br/> Because I had the better understanding of Node.JS and backend technology, I took over the functional portion of the skill while Brian took the front-end portion. For those who don't know, Alexa devices are more than just the Echo dot that gets advertised all over the world. Alexa can run on headphones and even cars. Thus, Brian's job was to design a visual interface that could work on Alexas with screens but wasn't so critical to the skill that ALexas without screens would suffer. He did a phenomenal job, pouring through thousands of lines of code and documentation to get the screens operational in time. <br/><br/> Similary, I had to go through thousands of lines of code and tear through Github trying to find people with example skills I could examine. The reason we had so much difficult was that we were among the first people to start developing for Alexa. The Alexa Skill Development Kit (SDK) was still relatively new, so new that there were very few resources online to help us out. A good chunk of our time was devoted solely to learning the new interface. That difficult was a big reason why I elected to make our code public on Github for the months after the competition. Once the volume of skills picked up, we took it private again to be cautious with our API keys. <br/><br/> In the end, our skill was published in time for the competition, though we did not win any prize. Nonetheless, the project was a great way for Brian and I to get into the trenches of software development. It was also fun playing with the app when we got back to campus with our friends. Like I had hoped, the skill comes in handy for settling arguments of where to eat. A few months after the competition, I was showing the skill to some friends on the skill store when I saw that 150+ people had used our skill. Given we didn't advertise our skill at all, that was very cool to find out. In closing, this project was a stellar way to spend a winter break. </p><center><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Matthew-Gunton-Co-You-Choose/dp/B07NGT7LG4/ref=sr_1_7?keywords=you+choose&qid=1564669232&s=digital-skills&sr=1-7">Try It For Yourself!</a></center> <br/><br/> <a href="https://maurelius.com/GuntonAndSnyder/privacy.pdf">Privacy Policy for the Skill</a><br/> <a href="https://maurelius.com/GuntonAndSnyder/termsOfUse.pdf">Terms of Service for the Skill</a> </div><% include ../partials/footer.ejs%></body></html>
