My mother runs a private opthamology practice, and her website at the time was from the early 2000s. If nothing else, the website had to let my mother's patients know what insurance she took and what her offices are. <br/><br/> Learning Boostrap & CSS3 as I went, I built a website that was very easy to use. I chose colors that are bright and calming as well as fonts that come out clean and easy to read. Looking back on it, I'm proud at how good the website looks roughly 3 years after it was published. Medicine is well-known for wanting technology that will never fail, and I think I succeeded in designing a website that can be useful for a very long time. </p></div><% include ../partials/footer.ejs%></body></html>
