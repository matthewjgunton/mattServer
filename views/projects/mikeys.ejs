Always eager to try new things, I replied that I hadn't, but would love to enter it with him. Assembling two of our other good friends, we began working on the project. <br/><br/> The deliverable of the competition was to create a <a href="https://maurelius.com/ConsultingCompetition/presentation.pdf">presentation</a> and <a href="https://maurelius.com/ConsultingCompetition/ExecutiveSummary.pdf">executive summary</a> that helps the Mikey's team figure out how to reach price conscious consumers. <br/><br/> <center><img style="width: 80%" src="/images/mikey2.jpg"/></center> Our team began by doing thorough research into the market of health conscious food by digging through statistics and interviewing people who were buyers. I got to interview a few good friends of mine who were gluten-sensitive and find out lots about the what matters to them. If nothing else, they were upset that the fad dieters had made gluten-free a less respected diet choice. A few of my friends had Celiac's Disease, and thus would suffer severe health costs if they chose to eat gluten products. Thus, it became clear to me that grouping everyone into the health conscious food market was overgeneralizing. One had to start looking at the market as 3 distinct segments, so a major part of our presentation became the 3 segments of the market we believed we saw. <br/><br/> Nonetheless, we wouldn't have gone as far in the competition without having a great team. Dave designed all the visuals that appear on the powerpoint slide, making sure the aesthetic highlights the segments point in the presentation. Aidan Gales did deep research into elastic and inelastic demands, finding data that was beyond his schooling to help support our claims. Finally, Joseph Minh was instrumental in finding the hard data that supports virtually every one of our claims in the executive summary. We did the work for the competition largely over spring break and at late hours of the night after our work for the day was over. I'm very thankful to have been part of such a hard working team. </p></div><% include ../partials/footer.ejs%></body></html>
