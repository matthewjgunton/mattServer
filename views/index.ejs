      <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Gunton, and I am a Computer Science and Business student at Lehigh University. Previously I went to the Lawrenceville School where I graduated Cum Laude. I enjoy writing programs that make tedious tasks faster and more enjoyable. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.JS, MongoDB, React, React Native, and Alexa.</p>

        <p>“I enthusiastically recommend Matthew Gunton for a position in software development. Matthew worked with me in his Summer internship, here at InstaMed, to complete a product feature. I found Matthew intelligent, creative, and industrious. He was able to work in both a greenfield environment as well as in very large codebase to solve technical challenges and implement code. He successfully completed a fully functioning feature and demoed it to the upper management and technical peers. I have no doubt that he will be successful in his software development career.”</p>
