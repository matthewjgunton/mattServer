      <p>Hello, my name is Matthew Gunton, and I am a Computer Science and Business student at Lehigh University. Previously I went to the Lawrenceville School where I graduated Cum Laude. I enjoy writing programs that make tedious tasks faster and more enjoyable. I know HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.JS, MongoDB, React, React Native, and Alexa.</p>

        <p>"During his time at VRCâ€™s Summer Internship program, Matthew demonstrated a sharp mind and strong work ethic. Matthew navigated well through the program despite large volumes of new information and complex problem solving challenges. Matthew would be perfect for a leadership position given his high level of motivation, positive attitude and natural ability to direct a group and we wish him the best of luck in future endeavors."</p>
